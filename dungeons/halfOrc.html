        Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, 
        orc and human communities, sometimes form alliances. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. 
        Some half-orcs rise to become proud leaders of orc communities. Some venture into the world to prove their worth.
        Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds.

    <h2 class="heading">Scarred and Strong</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Half-orcs exhibit a blend of orcish and human characteristics, and their appearance varies widely. 
        Grayish skin tones and prominent teeth are the most common shared elements among these folk. <br><br>
        Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, 
        though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former prisoner or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, 
        whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries.

    <h2 class="heading">The Mark of Gruumsh</h2><hr>
    <p>
        The one-eyed god Gruumsh—lord of war and fury—created the first orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship carry 
        his blessings of might and endurance. The same is true of half-orcs. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, 
        calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh's exultation when they join in melee combat — and either exult along 
        with him or shiver with fear and loathing.<br><br>
        Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. 
        An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple pleasures — feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, 
        and wild dancing — fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. 
        And when their hearts swell with love, they leap to perform acts of great kindness and compassion.
