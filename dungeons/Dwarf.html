    <p>Kingdom rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, 
        the echoing of picks and hammers in the deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition.<br>
        These are the common threads that unite all dwarves
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Short and stout</h2><hr>
    <p>
        They are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. They are under 5 feet tall. Very compact and broad that they weigh as much as humans.<br>
        Their skin ranges from a deep brown to a white pale. Their hair is usually long and in a simple style being, black, grey, or brown. Though the paler dwarves have red hair.<br>
        Male dwarves value their beards and groom them carefully.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Long Memory & Long grudges</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world.
        Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans,
       tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly.<br>
       Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs 
       they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Clans and Kingdoms</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, 
        and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice.The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations,
        recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. 
        To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.<br>
        Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Gods,Gold, and Clan</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others.
        Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, 
        a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods.<br>
        Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. 
        Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.
