    <p>
        Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. 
        They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light,<br>
        where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, 
        music and poetry, and the good things of the world.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Slender and Graceful</h2><hr>
    <p>
        With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races.
        They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, 
        weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.<br><br>
        Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, 
        bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver.
        Elves have no facial and little body hair. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">A Timeless Perspective</h2><hr>
    <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply.
        They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission 
        or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. 
        They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Exploration and Adventure</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. 
        They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, <br>
        so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or 
        gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, 
        and others might become champions of moral causes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Subrace</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. 
        Choose one of the two subraces presented below or one from another source. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further 
        (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.

    <h2 class="heading">Elf Traits</h2><hr>
    <p>
        <b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.<br>
        <b>Age: </b>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond 
        physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.<br>
        <b>Size: </b>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.<br>
        <b>Speed: </b>our base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
        <b>DarkVision: </b>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. 
        You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
        <b>Keen senses: </b>You have proficiency in the Perception skill.<br>
        <b>Fey Ancestry: </b>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.<br>
        <b>Trance: </b>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually 
        mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br>
        <b>Languages: </b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Eladrin (Variant)</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane,
        appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.<br><br>
        <b>Ablility Score Increase: </b>Your Intelligence score increases by 1.<br>
        <b>Elf Weapon Training: </b> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
        <b>Fey Step: </b>You can cast the misty step spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">High Elf</h2><hr>
    <p>
        As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. 
        One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, 
        believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, 
        and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.<br><br>
        The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. 
        Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. 
        They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.<br><br>
        <b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Your Intelligence score increases by 1.<br>
        <b>Elf Weapon Training: </b>You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
        <b>Cantrip: </b>You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.<br>
        <b>Extra Language: </b>You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Wood Elf</h2><hr>
    <p>
        As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. 
        This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. 
        In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.<br><br>
        Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. 
        Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.<br><br>
        <b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br>
        <b>Elf Weapon Training: </b>You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
        <b>Fleet of Foot: </b>Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.<br>
        <b>Mask of the Wild: </b>You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
