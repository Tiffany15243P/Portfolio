    <p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, 
       far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and 
       fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, 
       others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to 
       discover the wonders of new lands and peoples.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Small and Practical</h2><hr>
    <p>
        The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. 
        Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the 
        edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds. <br><br>
        Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy.
        They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. 
        They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Kind and Curious</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, 
        harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. 
        They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Blend into the Crowd</h2>
    <p>
        Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. 
        The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Pastoral Pleasantries</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much 
        land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don't recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. 
        Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.<br><br>
        Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings' hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. 
        Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Exploring Opportunites</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Halflings usually set out on the adventurer's path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. 
        For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.
