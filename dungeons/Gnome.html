    <h1>Gnome</h1>

    <p>
        A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: 
        a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, 
        enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.  
    </p>
    <h2>Vibrant Expression</h2><hr>
    <p>
        A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. 
        Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. 
        Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.<br><br>
        A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully 
        trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.

    <h2>Delighted Decication</h2><hr>
    <p>
        As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. 
        Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, 
        but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see. <br><br>
        Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, 
        adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Bright Burrows</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. 
        Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are 
        unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.<br><br>
        Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. 
        A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.
    </p>
    <h2>Seeing the World</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. 
        Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.
